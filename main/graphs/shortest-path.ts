/*
Write a function, shortestPath, that takes in an array of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (nodeA, nodeB). 
The function should return the length of the shortest path between A and B. 
Consider the length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes. If there is no path between A and B, then return -1.

Ex.

const edges = [
  ['w', 'x'],
  ['x', 'y'],
  ['z', 'y'],
  ['z', 'v'],
  ['w', 'v'],
]

*/

export const shortestPath = (
    edges: string[][],
    nodeA: string,
    nodeB: string
) => {};
